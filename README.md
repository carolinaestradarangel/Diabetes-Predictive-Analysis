# Diabetes-Predictive-Analysis

This project is based on the issue to solve and note the biggest factors that play a role in diabetes. This is based on the interest that almost 2 million people yearly get diagnosed with diabetes, increasing every year in numbers. A way to combat this issue is to identify the main causes for this condition and spread awareness about those specific factors to reduce the number of people that are diagnosed with diabetes. 
This project can be found on Kaggle where visualizations and descriptions are identified there.
